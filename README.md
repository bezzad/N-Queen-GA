# N-Queen by Genetic Algorithm
Solve N-Queen problem by Genetic Algorithm (GA) in JavaScript.

## How to execute
1. First install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Set your GA parameters at [index.js](https://github.com/bezzad/N-Queen-GA/blob/master/index.js):
```
//               N , Pop, SR, MR, ReGen, CR
var ga = new GA(200, 500, 10, 50, 10000, 75);

// N:       Number of Queens in the NÃ—N Chess Board
// Pop:     Population size
// SR:      Selection probability %
// MR:      Mutation probability %
// ReGen:   Regeneration limitation
// CR:      Max Chromosomes Convergence Rate % 
```

3. Go to root folder and run below code in `Bash` or `CMD` and press Enter: <br>
    ```
    $ node index.js
    ```

>**Note**   
 This project independent from any libraries. So don't need to run `npm install`.
 
<br/><br/>
The GA executed and printed an answer like this:
```
Starting GA ...
generation 100, elite fitness is 2
GA ended due to the best chromosome found :)
